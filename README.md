# JavaScript to Ambients Compiler _(js2amb)_

> Compiles JavaScript to Ambient protocol syntax

## Background

[Ambients](https://ambients.org) is a protocol for distributed computation. It allows you to request and execute computation as easily as you can data inside OrbitDB. Think of it like AWS Lambda or Azure Cloud functions, but on a decentralized peer-to-peer network.

The protocol also includes guarantees as to the verfiability and safety of the code, all without a blockchain.
